Projects name: NYUAD Cats is a project close to my heart, created to celebrate the furry residents of New York University Abu Dhabi. During my time at the university, I've found so much joy in the company of these cats, each with their own unique quirks and personalities. This project aims to share their stories and encourage our community to support their well-being.

The website serves as an engaging platform where visitors can explore photos of each cat, learn about their backgrounds, and discover ways to contribute to their care. I incorporated an image gallery that highlights their playful antics, along with a section featuring an embedded YouTube video to bring their stories to life. The design is simple yet vibrant, aiming to create a warm atmosphere that reflects the charm of our feline friends.

The idea behind this project is to foster a sense of connection and compassion. I wanted to build a community that recognizes the importance of looking after our animal friends, and I hope this site inspires others to take a moment to appreciate the cats around us. After all, these little creatures bring so much joy to our lives, and they deserve our love and attention.

Process: To bring my concept to life, before diving into coding, I created a wireframe to map out the structure of the site. This helped me visualize the layout and plan how users would navigate through the content.

Using HTML and CSS, I designed a user-friendly interface that emphasizes visual appeal. Key features include:

1) Image Gallery: A dedicated section showcasing photos of the cats, allowing visitors to connect with their playful spirit.
2) YouTube Integration: An embedded video that shares stories and insights about the cats, creating a more dynamic experience.
3) Interactive Elements: Buttons that guide users to learn more and explore different sections of the site.
Throughout the implementation, I focused on maintaining consistency in design while ensuring the website was responsive and engaging. At the same time, the wireframe served as a valuable reference, helping me stay organized and aligned with my vision for the project.

Reflection/Evaluation:

Looking back at the initial concept, my goal was to create a space that not only celebrates our beloved cats but also encourages empathy and community support. I'm thrilled with how the final version turned out; it blends aesthetics with functionality beautifully. Friends and classmates have shared positive feedback, especially about the interactive features, which made the site enjoyable and engaging.

As I worked through the project, I learned just how important it is to iterate and test my ideas. There were definitely challenges along the way, like making sure everything looked good on different devices. But each hurdle taught me something valuable, and I feel like I’ve grown as a developer.

Overall, the project truly captures the spirit of community and care I wanted to convey. It’s been rewarding to see the project come together, and I hope it resonates with others as much as it does with me.
